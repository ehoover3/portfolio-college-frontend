# The Problem

Asymmetric information, also known as "information failure," occurs when one party to an economic transaction possesses greater material knowledge than the other party.

Many 18 year old college students frequently choose a college, but may not know that choosing to enroll in a comparable college could save them $50,000 or more.

# The Solution

This program allows students to input a school search, which then shows:

- an interactive map showing school locations
- a list that compares schools cost
- a field that shows the estimated savings between 2 or more colleges
